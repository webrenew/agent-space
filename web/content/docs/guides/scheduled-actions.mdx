# Scheduled Actions

Use **Scheduled Actions** for recurring prompts that should run on a timetable.

Examples:

- Daily repository health checks
- Hourly sync/status summaries
- Weekday release readiness checks
- Routine maintenance prompts

If you need to process a **finite list of todos** until completion, use [Todo Runner](/docs/guides/todo-runner) instead.

## Open Scheduler

Go to **Settings -> Schedules**.

Each schedule includes:

- name
- cron expression
- working directory
- prompt
- YOLO mode toggle
- runtime status (`idle`, `running`, `success`, `error`)

## Create A Schedule

1. Click **+ Add Schedule**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Task name**
   - **Cron**: `minute hour day month weekday`
   - **Directory**: target workspace path
   - **Prompt**: exact recurring work instruction
3. Save the task.
4. Click **Run now** once to validate before waiting for cron.

## Cron Expression Reference

Agent Observer uses a 5-field cron format:

`minute hour day month weekday`

Common examples:

- `*/15 * * * *` every 15 minutes
- `0 * * * *` every hour
- `0 9 * * 1-5` 9:00 AM weekdays
- `30 18 * * *` 6:30 PM every day
- `0 2 * * 0` 2:00 AM every Sunday

## Prompt Design For Recurring Jobs

Use deterministic prompt structure:

1. State objective in one sentence.
2. Define scope (repo/path/system).
3. Define output format (short report, checklist, pass/fail summary).
4. Define failure behavior (stop, retry externally, or alert).

Good recurring prompt shape:

- "Run X checks in Y directory, summarize failures grouped by severity, include next 3 actions."

Avoid:

- open-ended prompts with no expected output structure
- prompts that mutate many files without strict boundaries

## Validation Checklist

After saving a schedule:

1. **Run now** succeeds once.
2. `Last run` and duration fields update.
3. `Next run` is populated as expected.
4. Errors (if any) are visible in the schedule card.

## Runtime Model

- Scheduler loop checks tasks regularly.
- Only enabled tasks run.
- Running tasks are not started twice.
- Manual and cron-triggered runs share the same execution path.
- Schedule definitions are persisted locally.

### Pending Backlog Cap

- Pending cron backlog is bounded per task to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Default per-task cap: `240` pending minute entries.
- Oldest pending entries are dropped first (newest entries are retained).
- Operator signal: diagnostics event `scheduler.tick.backlog_capped`.
- Optional override: `AGENT_SPACE_SCHEDULER_PENDING_BACKLOG_LIMIT` (`1` to `1440`).

Persistence location:

- `~/.agent-observer/schedules.json`

## Failure Modes And Fixes

### Schedule stays idle

- Verify it is enabled.
- Verify cron is valid (5 fields).
- Verify app is running at scheduled time.

### Immediate error on run

- Verify directory exists and is readable.
- Verify prompt is non-empty.
- Verify underlying runner/tooling dependencies are available.

### Wrong files being touched

- Correct working directory.
- Tighten prompt scope with explicit path constraints.
- Disable task until prompt is corrected.

## Operational Safety

For high-impact recurring tasks:

1. Test with a short interval in a staging repo.
2. Review 2-3 consecutive successful runs.
3. Move to production schedule.
4. Keep a rollback plan for unintended changes.
