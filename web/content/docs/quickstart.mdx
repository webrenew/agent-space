# Quickstart

This quickstart gets a new install from zero to a validated workflow in about 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- macOS on Apple Silicon
- Local access to at least one development directory
- One agent runtime available (Claude Code CLI, Anthropic Agent SDK worker, or both)

## Install Agent Observer

1. Download the latest release from the [website installer](/download).
2. Open the `.dmg`.
3. Drag **Agent Observer** into `Applications`.
4. Launch from `Applications`.

## First-Run Setup

1. Set your default working directory in the onboarding flow.
2. Grant file permissions for your project folder when prompted.
3. Open the target repository from Explorer.
4. Confirm the selected workspace path before starting chat.

## Run Your First Workspace-Scoped Session

1. Open chat.
2. Send a narrow prompt tied to one file or one goal.
3. Use `@` mentions to reference exact files.
4. Watch status and token updates in the side panels while the run executes.

Expected result:

- Chat responses stream normally.
- Agent status transitions from active states to `done` (or `error` with diagnostics).
- Token counters increase when model/tool work happens.

## Validate Search and File Context

1. Open the Search panel.
2. Search for a known file name from your repository.
3. Open the result in the editor panel.
4. Reference the same file in chat via `@` mention.

Expected result:

- Search returns files inside your selected workspace.
- Referenced files are attached to chat context exactly as selected.

## Validate Background Automation Paths

Use the two automation features for different workloads:

- **Schedules** (`Settings -> Schedules`): recurring cron-based prompts.
- **Todo Runner** (`Settings -> Todo Runner`): sequential execution of a large checklist until completed.

Quick sanity checks:

1. Create one disabled schedule and save.
2. Create one Todo Runner job with 2 short todo items and save.
3. Confirm both entries appear with status metadata in Settings.

## First Production Checklist

Before using Agent Observer for long unattended runs:

1. Confirm workspace path is correct.
2. Confirm required filesystem permissions are granted.
3. Keep prompts specific and bounded.
4. Use small dry runs before large todo lists.
5. Verify your fallback path for failures (logs + retry strategy).

## If Something Fails

- Workspace path looks wrong: see [Workspace Scope](/docs/guides/workspace-scope)
- Scheduler not firing: see [Scheduled Actions](/docs/guides/scheduled-actions)
- Todo list not progressing: see [Todo Runner](/docs/guides/todo-runner)
- General runtime issues: see [Troubleshooting](/docs/reference/troubleshooting)
