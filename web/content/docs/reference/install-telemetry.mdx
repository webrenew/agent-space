# Install Telemetry

Agent Observer uses an anonymous install beacon to power install-driven world growth tiers.

## What Is Collected

Beacon payload (`POST /api/install-beacon`):

- `installation_id_hash`: SHA-256 hash of a locally generated random installation ID
- `app_version`: desktop app version string (example: `1.2.0`)
- `first_seen_at`: ISO timestamp from the installation's first launch

## Why It Is Collected

- dedupe unique installs for world-state progression
- measure aggregate install growth without storing personal identifiers
- detect ingest health and data quality issues

## What Is Not Collected

- no raw installation ID in backend ingest payload
- no usernames, emails, prompts, workspace paths, or file contents
- no persisted source IPs in install aggregate storage

## Retention Policy

Desktop local files:

- `~/.agent-observer/install-beacon.json`: stores local installation ID and beacon delivery state

Backend aggregate store:

- stores deduped hashed installation records and first/last seen timestamps
- persistence path is controlled by `AGENT_OBSERVER_INSTALL_BEACON_STORE_FILE`
- if unset, default storage path is `/tmp/agent-observer-install-beacon-store.json`

Rate limiting data:

- source-IP and installation hash buckets are in-memory only
- buckets are short-lived and automatically pruned

## Opt-Out

In desktop app:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Diagnostics**
3. Disable **Anonymous install beacon**

When disabled, new install beacons are not sent from that app instance.

## Verification

Opt-out and idempotency behavior are covered by smoke tests:

- `tests/smoke/install-beacon.spec.ts`
- `tests/smoke/install-beacon-backend.spec.ts`
